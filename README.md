# React Counter V2

Training project for React.
You have a counter, clicking on the plus or minus sign increments or decrements the counter (min 0 and max 10).
There's also a "Add counter" button which creates another counter, you can have up to three counters.
Each counter works independently.

Main difficulty : I'm only using one state to manage everything.

### Main features :

- states hook on an array
- ternary conditions
- mapping
- event handler (onClick)
